Jenkins Basic Overview:

Monitoring -> Polling the source code for any change -> Plugin
Checkout the code
Build
Unit testing / Code Coverage
Notification

Jenkins is an Orchestration Tool or Build Tool
Project in Jenkins
Jobs in Jenkins
Jenkins have Open Source and Enterprise Version (Hosted in Cloud, Need Licence)

Security => Role Based Access in Jenkins:
Default Read Access: Reader Role
Build Role: Builder Role -> Application Team
Configure Role: Configurer Role -> DevOps
Admin Access: Admin

Master have all the configuration of the Job
Slave is the actual executor of the Job

Build History
One Master and Multiple Slave we can configure

Jenkins Lab Server for testing:

New Job: 
Click on New Job-> Name -> Freestyle Project -> Ok 

Jenkins Workspace:
Source Code
Compiled Artifact

Inside Jenkins Job:
BUILD_TIME_STAMP
Discard old builds
	Strategy: Log Rotation
		Days to keep build:
		Max: 20
Meta Data:
Sidebar links
Project is parameterized
	Boolean 
	Choice
Disable this project
Execute concurrent builds:
	JDK: Select
Restrict:
	Label: Any
SCM:
	Git/ SVN
	Generic credentials
	Rep Depth:
		Infinity: go till
		Empty: only deploy folder
		file: only the file
		Immediate: Immdidate
		As-it-is: as it is
	Ignore Externals: call another svn url (Mostly we does)
	Checkout Strategy: svn update
Use custom workspace: Limit the character
	Directory: 
	Display name:
Build Triggers:
	Build Periodically: 
		Schedule: Cron Job (M H D M D), it will always trigger
	Poll SCM: 
		Schedule: Same (H/15 * * * * ), trigger only if changes occurred
Build Env:
	Delete the workspace
	Add time stamp
	Set Env var
Build: 
	Console script, Run the script with the compilation
	Ex:
		Invoke Ant:
			Ant Version: ant-…
			Targets: clean prepare compile (set of instruction to perform)
			Build File: always relative file, dependent on checkout location
			Properties: 
				Hudson_home=D://Slave//Jenkins
				Workspace=$WORKSPACE
				buildNumber=$BUILD_NUMBER
				Env.HuDSON_HOME=D:\\slave\\jenkins
				Projectname=$JOB_NAME
				JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME
				Svn.revision=$SVN_REVISION
				addDir=$WORKSPACE\\deploy\\..
			Java Options: 
Post Build Action:
	Used to publish
	Publish JUnit test result report
		Test: Location of xml
		Health: 1.0

Steps need to perform in Jenkins:
	1. Publishing unit testing/ code coverage results
	2. Uploading/ deploying the pkg to UCD (deployment tool)
	3. Email notifications 
	
Steps in Jenkins Job:
	Basic Configuration
	SVN Checkout
	Create/update build environment
	Build/unit test
	Package creation
	Upload pkg /deploy the pkg to UCD

Plugin used:
Post build actions:
	Publish artifacts to TADP IBM Urbancode deploy server
		Version:Sept2017_REV$(SVN_REVISION)_B$(BUILD_NUMBER)
