POLL SCM 

Difference between Build Triggered and Poll SCM Jobs ?
Build Triggered: It executes the specific job as per your configurations 
Poll SCM: It executes only if some commits happens 

Definition:
Poll SCM periodically polls the SCM to check whether changes were made (i.e. new commits) and builds the project if new commits where pushed since the last build, whereas build periodically builds the project periodically even if nothing has changed.
